## How to use / modify
Clone/fork this repository, and change the dweet.io thing name in the url, by replacing `fortyseveneffects-raspi-monitor` with whatever you like.
Then clone the Freeboard.io dashboard, edit the datasource to match your thing name and run the script on your machine (not necessarily a Pi). Voila !
